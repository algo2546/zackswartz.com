                <h2>About me</h2>
                <p>
                    Unrelated to software development, I love fitness, research (of any topic I am interested in),
                    entrepreneurship, and the outdoors.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In my free time I work out, fish, and love to hang out with friends and family.

                <h2>Football</h2>
                <p>
                    Football played a large role in my life prior to coming to undergrad. I chose to forego several
                    D1 offers in order to pursue studying premed.
                </p>
                <p>
                    My aspirations were to pursue an MD/DO and PhD program to become a cancer researcher due to my
                    interest in reading cancer research in high school.

        <!-- Undergraduate Ride -->

            <div class="about-text">
                <h2>Undergraduate ride</h2>
                <p>
                    During my first semester of undergrad I got accepted into a renowned research lab. Around the same
                    time I cofounded a coffee business and won WV's 2021 business plan competition.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I began to realize I was not loving the lab environment due to the inefficient repetitive work.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Consequently, I switched to finance but finished most of my premed classes, afraid I would have a
                    change of heart.
                </p>
                <p>
                    After taking a few business classes I switched to Accounting and Management Information Systems,
                    as it felt like a better fit.

                <h2>Fishing</h2>
                <p>
                    I love fishing. I wanted to add a section of a couple beautiful fish I had the wonderful experience
                    of catching during undergrad :-)
